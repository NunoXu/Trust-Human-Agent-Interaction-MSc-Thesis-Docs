I want thank to my dissertation supervisors Prof. Rui Prada and Prof. Ana Paiva for their support, advice and guidance in the making of this Thesis and throughout my academic life.

Additionally, I would like to thank Tiago Ribeiro, Sofia Petisca and Sandra SÃ¡, for the help they gave to make this Thesis a reality.



Finally, I want to give special thanks to Bruno Henriques, for the collaboration that made User Studies much less lonely, and to Tiago Santos, that offered me his couch to crash in the most critical moments of writing need.
