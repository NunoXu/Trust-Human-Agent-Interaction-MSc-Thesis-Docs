\section{Proposed Solution}
\label{sec:Solution}
In this Section we will address our current planning for our solution, and will start with Trust Assessment Module, in Section \ref{subsec:Solution:Trust Assessment Module}, go on to the Trust Decision Making Module, in Section and finally talk about how they connect together and to the rest of an agent architecture.


\subsection{Trust Assessment Module}
\label{subsec:Solution:Trust Assessment Module}
In this module we aim to create a trust representation of the user. The model must be able to represent the user's beliefs while also provide a ranking on how trustworthy is the agent. To do this, we will base the model on the work made by Pinyol\cite{Pinyol2009}, described in Section \ref{subsubsec:Related work:Trust Models:BDI + Repage}, that is we plan to use a model based on the Repage architecture
