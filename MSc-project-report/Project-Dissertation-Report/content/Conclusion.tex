\label{sec:Conclusion}
We started by introducing our thoughts about the lack of research done in the area of trust in \ac{HRI}, especially regarding trust improvement, and how we want to address that issue by tackling one of the gaps exposed in the research: action suggestion to improve trust and their beliefs. So we summed up our main goal as to develop an action suggestion module capable of giving out actions that will improve trust in the agent.
