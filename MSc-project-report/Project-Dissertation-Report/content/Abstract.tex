Trust is an essential ingredient for cooperation and collaboration, so if we want to further develop autonomous collaborative agents we must address the issue of trust in such relationships. For that reason computational trust has seen a great spike of interest in recent years, but the literature has been only focused in issues like design, animation and modelling. We aim to address the uncharted matter of actively improve trust by developing a module capable of suggesting actions to the agent. Our solution will also need a trust model of the user. So in this report we explore the state of the art in trust modelling and decision making, while defining the major concepts used in the literature. Afterwards we discuss our solution and its basis on the Repage architecture. Finally project evaluation is planned out and scheduled..
