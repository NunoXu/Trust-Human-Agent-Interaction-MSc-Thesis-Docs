Trust is an essential ingredient for cooperation and collaboration, so if we want to further develop autonomous collaborative agents we must address the issue of trust in such relationships. For that reason computational trust has seen a great spike of interest in recent years, but the literature has been only focused in issues like design, animation and modelling. We aim to address the uncharted matter of actively improve trust by developing a module capable of suggesting actions to the agent. So in this report we explore some of the state of the art in trust modelling, while defining the major concepts used in the literature.
