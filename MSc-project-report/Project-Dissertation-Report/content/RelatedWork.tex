\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:Related Work}
Computational Trust research has been focused on modelling trust in \acp{MAS}, specially on open e-commerce environments\cite{Granatyr2015, HanYu2013, Pinyol2013, Noorian2010, Huang2008}, with at least 106 models created\cite{Granatyr2015}, since the formalization of trust as a measurable property by Marsh in 1994 \cite{Marsh1994}. We will present some trust models from which we will take inspiration while creating our own, and some work done in measuring trust in \ac{HRI}.

\subsection{Trust Models}
\label{subsec:Related work:Trust Models}
For related work concerning Trust Models we will focus on \textbf{Cognitive} Trust Models, first introduced by Castelfranchi and Falcone\cite{Castelfranchi1998}, as we want to focus on modelling trust through multiple dimensions, with the intent of having trust depend on the action to perform, context and agent performing the task and having these dimensions represented explicitly in the model, something that it is not possible with \textbf{Numerical}, like the one introduced by \cite{Marsh1994}.

\subsubsection{Castelfranchi and Falcone}
Having developed the concept of Cognitive Trust Models, this author's model is generally regarded as a classical basis for most other authors, and while we will not use this model directly, it is worth describing it in this report, as it was also a source of inspiration to other authors referenced in this report. 
The model is defined around their definition referred in Section \ref{subsubsec:CastelfranchiTrust}, 

 quantifies trust by defining \textbf{Degrees of Trust}

\subsection{The Perception and Measurement of Human-Robot Trust}
\label{subsec:Related work:The Perception and Measurement of Human-Robot Trust}

Schaefer\cite{Schaefer2009} presents a trust perception scale, that provides a way of extracting an accurate trust score from humans interacting with robots. The scale is composed of 40 items that can be ranked from 0 to 100, in 10 point intervals. The final result it then averaged by adding all the item values and divided by the total number of items (40).



While this work has been done specifically for \ac{HRI} we believe that a sub-set of this items can be used for the features used in the cognitive model of the user's trust, further described in Section %todo give refence here
