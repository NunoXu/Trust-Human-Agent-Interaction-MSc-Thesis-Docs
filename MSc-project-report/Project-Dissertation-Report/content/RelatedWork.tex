\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:Related Work}
Computational Trust research has been focused on modelling trust in \acp{MAS}, specially on open e-commerce environments\cite{Granatyr2015, HanYu2013, Pinyol2013, Noorian2010, Huang2008}, with at least 106 models created\cite{Granatyr2015}, since the formalization of trust as a measurable property by Marsh in 1994 \cite{Marsh1994}.

\subsection{Trust Models}
\label{subsec:Related work:Trust Models}
For related work concerning Trust Models we will focus on Cognitive Trust Models, first introduced by Castelfranchi et. al.\cite{Castelfranchi1998}, as we want to focus on modelling trust based on the Agent's mental state, specially when considering that our goal is to apply the trust model to human partners.

\subsubsection{Castelfranchi et. al.}
Having introduced the concept of Cognitive Trust Models, this author's model is generally used as a basis for most other authors, % TODO Insert citation here, check ReGrET


The work I will be comparing my work with (direct influence, biggest part of this document, has to make sense, it has to show the relevance of mine work in a international way)


In data-driven timing generation for social behaviors, using \ac{ML} techniques, it is retrieved two types of samples: positive samples representing the moments (or timings) in the interaction that are socially acceptable to generate a backchannel gesture (e.g., a head nod or a vocalization "hmm hmm") and negative samples as the moments when it is unacceptable. In previous approaches, corpus based, positive samples are taken directly from the annotated dataset and the negative randomly as long as they do not overlap with a positive sample.
