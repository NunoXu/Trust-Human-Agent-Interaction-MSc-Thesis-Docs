\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:Evaluation}
As stated in Section \ref{sec:Introduction}, the project's evaluation will be done by integrating the developed modules in a agent, now finishing development, that is capable of acting as a player in the \textit{Split or Steal} scenario, introduced in the British television show \textit{Golden Balls}\cite{Wikipedia.Golden.Balls}. The scenario involves two players and stands as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A large sum of money is prized for the game;
	\item Each player receives two balls, one has `Steal' written inside while the other has `Split';
	\item The balls can be stealthily open by the players, so only each player knows is written in what ball;
	\item \label{enum:split.steal.neg}The players then have some time to discuss and negotiate between one another;
	\item Finally the players choose one of their balls and show their content simultaneously and the game finalizes, giving one of the following results:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If both players choose `Split', they split the prize money evenly;
		\item If one picks `Steal' and the other `Split', the stealer gets all the prize money;
		\item If both pick `Steal', they both lose all the prize money.
	\end{itemize}	
\end{enumerate}

From a game theory standpoint, this scenario is a variation on \textit{Prisoner's Dilemma}, described in Section \ref{subsubsec:PrisonersDilemma}, where defecting only weakly dominates cooperating, because if an opposing player picks `Steal' we get nothing whether we pick `Steal' or `Split', so `Steal' only dominates if the opposing player picks `Split'.

Evaluation will be performed through user testing of the agent, and we will try to gather at least 30 participants to ensure statistical viability. The testers will then be separated into two equally distributed groups, which we will designate by group \textit{A} and \textit{B}. Group \textit{A} will be the control group. We will focus evaluation in step 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Perform a series of \textit{Split or Steal} games 
\end{enumerate}
